1. Ensure you're logged into to your Google account
2. Select "Deselect All" option at the top of the page
3. Scroll down to where "Location History" is listed and check only that box
4. Click "Next Step" at bottom of page

## TODO
#### Generate.py
Need to figure out what additional data processing we should do at the basic level (eg, saving days of the week, etc).  

#### .ipynb
